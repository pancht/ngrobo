    Page class is the base class for every _page objects
    that one is going to be created for his/her project.

    Page class inherits wrapper classes wraps the most
    frequently used api's of the Webdriver, WebElement,
    and other selenium classes which brings the power of
    readability of your scripts. Along with readable code,
    comes the power of highly maintainable and understandable
    code-base.

    And many more...
    I would request to checkout video tutorials uploaded at the
    following YouTube channel: https://shorturl.at/lpqKS

    Example usage: Assume that you want to create a Page Object
    in your automation project for home _page, then you should
    declare your Page Class as following:

    Package: pages
    File: home.py
    ============FileContent of home.py===========================

    from pages import Page
