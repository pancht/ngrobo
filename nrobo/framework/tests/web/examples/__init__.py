        Parameters:
            condition (Union[bool, str]) – Condition for marking the test function as xfail (True/False or a condition string). If a bool, you also have to specify reason (see condition string).
            
            reason (str) – Reason why the test function is marked as xfail.
            
            raises (Type[Exception]) – Exception class (or tuple of classes) expected to be raised by the test function; other exceptions will fail the test. Note that subclasses of the classes passed will also result in a match (similar to how the except statement works).
            
            run (bool) – Whether the test function should actually be executed. If False, the function will always xfail and will not be executed (useful if a function is segfaulting).
            
            strict (bool) –
            
            If False the function will be shown in the terminal output as xfailed if it fails and as xpass if it passes. In both cases this will not cause the test suite to fail as a whole. This is particularly useful to mark flaky tests (tests that fail at random) to be tackled later.
            
            If True, the function will be shown in the terminal output as xfailed if it fails, but if it unexpectedly passes then it will fail the test suite. This is particularly useful to mark functions that are always failing and there should be a clear indication if they unexpectedly start to pass (for example a new release of a library fixes a known bug).
            
            Defaults to xfail_strict, which is False by default.
